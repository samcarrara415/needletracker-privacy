    <h1>Privacy Policy for NeedleTracker</h1>
    <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: January 5, 2026</p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        NeedleTracker ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy.
        This Privacy Policy explains how our mobile application handles your information.
    </p>

    <h2>Information We Don't Collect</h2>
    <p>
        NeedleTracker does not collect, store, or transmit any personal information to our servers.
        We do not track you, we do not use analytics, and we do not share your data with third parties.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Storage</h2>
    <p>
        All data you create in NeedleTracker (including projects, threads, photos, and notes) is stored:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Locally on your device</strong> - Your data stays on your iPhone or iPad</li>
        <li><strong>In your personal iCloud account</strong> (if you enable iCloud sync) - Your data syncs between your devices using Apple's iCloud service</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        We do not have access to your iCloud data. Apple's privacy policy governs how iCloud handles your data.
    </p>

    <h2>Photos</h2>
    <p>
        When you choose to add photos to your projects, these photos are:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Stored only on your device and in your personal iCloud account</li>
        <li>Never uploaded to our servers</li>
        <li>Never shared with third parties</li>
        <li>Only accessible to you through the app</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>iCloud Sync</h2>
    <p>
        If you enable iCloud sync, your project data synchronizes across your devices using your personal iCloud account.
        This sync is handled entirely by Apple's iCloud service. We do not have access to your iCloud data.
    </p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>
        NeedleTracker does not integrate with any third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking services.
    </p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>
        Our app does not collect any personal information from anyone, including children under 13.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Security</h2>
    <p>
        Since all your data is stored locally on your device or in your personal iCloud account,
        the security of your data is managed by iOS and iCloud security features.
    </p>

    <h2>Your Rights</h2>
    <p>
        Since we don't collect your data, you have complete control over your information:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Delete the app to remove all local data</li>
        <li>Manage your iCloud data through iOS Settings</li>
        <li>No need to request data deletion from us (we don't have it)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>
        We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by
        updating the "Last Updated" date at the top of this policy.
    </p>
